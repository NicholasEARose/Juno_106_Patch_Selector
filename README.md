# JUNO-106 Patch Selector

## Overview

This is a simple, fun little tool designed to be open and used while you're experimenting with a Juno-106. I designed/built it becasue I don't have a manual and most of the sources I found online weren't searchable.

## Instructions

Feel free to edit the descriptions with whatever you want (my descriptions aren't the best, admittedly.) Hopefully this helps narrow down the time it takes to find a sound.

## Languages Used

Javascript, HTML, and CSS
